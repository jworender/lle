# setting time displacements in which each "event" occurs after the threshold is breached
# in the real world an even may not occur immediately after a condition is met, there may
# be a reaction time between meeting a condition and event commencement.  Possible Examples:
# 1) Price response for a shortage of production for a specific product. There is a certain
#    amount of inventory space for the product so vendors likely will not raise their prices
#    before they need to re-order.
# 2) Price response for shortage in production of a specific product precursor, that is, an
#    element of a product that that is required for product assembly, but which may have
#    substitutes available.  This means that multiple thresholds will need to be breached
#    in order to trigger a corresponding event.  And there may be a time displacement
#    associated with each threshold if a shortage in the preferred item causes cascading
#    shortages in the substitute items.
# 3) A safety incident that depends on several dangerous conditions occurring simultaneously
#    or in sequence.  A risk precursor that is measurable (say aggregate training levels)
#    may beget other conditions that take some time to materialize, thus creating a danger
#    signal if a certain sequence of measurable precursors occurs.
