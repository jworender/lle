## Introduction

This document was created by running the "Case_3_markdown.Rmd" file in RStudio.
It utilizes the script files "functions.R", "rectify.R", and "OR_encode.R",
within the "Code" directory in this repository, which are used to define the
functions that are called below.  This document will create all of the synthetic
data, fit the data to a model, and then display the results.  Anyone interested
is invited to clone or fork the repository and change the settings for the
purposes of self-demonstration. The verbiage here reflects the text in the
paper, but in some cases figures or examples that are present here were cut in
that document to stay within a ten page limit.

## Generate the Data

The data generation script is in the file named "build_case_3_data.R".  It will
generate three files: 1) dset, 2) dset_train, 3) dset_test.  The "dset" file is
a consolidated data set, and "dset_train" and "dset_test" files are mutually
exclusive subsets of "dset".  This document can be run it as a notebook, bock by
block, or it can also be knitted into an html document if desired.

The "relevant" data is taken from curves 5, 8, 9, 10, 13, 25, and 30.  They are
marked "RELEVANT" in the chart title.  The plots generated from the next code
block show 40 different curves, only 7 of which contain relevant data.  The
others are added to obfuscate the data and make the task of picking out the
relevant features and time steps harder.  The red markers on the curves show
the time steps for which all of the criteria for an event are met.  Each time
step generates an example which includes the data from the ten time steps before.

The data generation script will produce a plot of the entire data set for each
feature over each time step.  There are a large number of these plots, but the
process for generation and the explanation of the results is located below.
Note that there are only five curves for this case in order to keep the
computational burden down.  To change this, edit the "build_case_3_data.R" file.
In order for this markdown to work correctly, the relevant curves would need to
remain the same, but as many non-relevant curves as is desired can be added in.

```{r generate_data, echo=FALSE}
source("build_case_3_data.R")
```

## The data generation process

The following process is common to all of the synthetic data sets.

The simulated data was generated with the following requirements in mind:

1.	The data needed to be time-varying.  Each independent variable had a
    continuous stream of data that varied over time.  This was necessary to
    generate realistic scenarios that show the potential for analyzing lagged
    longitudinal data.
2.	The data needed to be range bound.  This reflected the desire to model
    realistic physical attributes, which tend to neither rise nor fall without
    end.
3.	The data needed to be complex.  In order to provide a convincing test, it
    needed to have no easily discernable pattern.
4.	The data needed to be cyclic.  Since the idea was to simulate sensor data or
    physical processes, and enough interactions needed to be generated in order
    to create a robust data set, some sort of cyclic process was necessary.

To meet these requirements, a sine function was chosen as the basic building
block for the simulated data.  Some additional details:

1.	When necessary, the Mersenne-Twister pseudorandom algorithm was used to
    generate pseudorandom numbers.  This is the default algorithm when
    generating pseudorandom numbers via the base R package.
2.	To generate complexity, multiple sine waves of varying frequency and
    amplitude were combined via superposition.
3.	The data was generated first, and then particular data streams were chosen
    and designated as the “relevant” features.
    
The procedure (the code is in the "build_case_1_data.R" script file):

1.	Generate a large number of sine waves with five possible randomly chosen
    frequencies per cycle.  Something like this was generated:  
    ![Curve Generation Step #1](../../Paper/Graphics/curve_generation_1.png)
2.  Superpose several of the curves generated in step 1.  Something like the
    curve next curve was generated by this step:  
    ![Curve Generation Step #2](../../Paper/Graphics/curve_generation_2.png)
3.	To create a diversity of values a new range was selected using a
    pseudorandom normal distribution centered on zero, standard deviation of
    0.05, and multiplied by 100. This produced a large enough diversity of
    magnitudes to demonstrate the range agnostic quality of the method.
4.	A version of the waves was shifted by a pre-determined amount to simulate
    lag.  The next graphic shows an example of this. Using lagged data simulates
    sensor data with readings that are time-late by an unknown amount, or an
    effect that has an unknown delay time between the change in reading and the
    occurrence of an event.   
    ![Curve Generation Step #3](../../Paper/Graphics/curve_generation_3.png)
5.	Assemble enough curves to have a large selection of potentially “relevant”
    and non-relevant curves.  Fig. 9 shows how the relevant curves are
    interpreted to generate events.  Note that the shifted curves determine when
    the event occurs, while the unshifted curves are matched with the time step
    in which they occurred to compose the data.  
    ![Curve Generation logical AND illustration](../../Paper/Graphics/curve_logical_AND.png)
6.	Each time step is interpreted as a separate example, and if all relevant
    curves meet the selection criteria during that time step, it is labeled as a
    “True” example, and otherwise is labeled as “False”.  The data for each
    example is taken from the unshifted curves.
7.	The data is next flattened such that a row contains the data from the
    current time step as well as the ten time steps previous (this is adjustable
    in the script).  The data from time steps zero (the current time step)
    through nine (the data nine time steps in the past) on the row for one
    example, for instance, will be the data for time steps one through ten on
    the next chronological example.  The next graphic illustrates:
    ![Curve Generation flatten](../../Paper/Graphics/curve_flatten.png)
8.	The final step is to randomize the rows to prevent any relationship between
    time steps from influencing the final outcome of the experiment.  There is
    no indication in the flattened data features where an example belongs
    chronologically with respect to the other examples.
9.	Once the data set has been created, it is split into training and testing
    sets with 70% of the data used for training and 30% of the data used for
    testing.

The procedure described generated a data set that included several relevant
features combined via a logical AND, is representative of what might be observed
with real sensor measurements and is complex enough to prevent any latent
patterns within the data from influencing the results.  The last example will
also illustrate what happens when a logical OR is introduced.

A data set with relevant features combined via a logical OR or a combination of
logical OR and logical AND will be generated in an identical way up to step 6.
Step 6 will be modified accordingly to generate the desired relationships among
the relevant variables.

```{r load_functions, echo=FALSE}
# Loading the functions that will be used to process the data - these are
# defined in a separate script file to allow re-use between markdown documents
# as well as create a set of generalized code that might be useful to others.
source("../../Code/functions.R")
source("../../Code/rectify.R")
source("../../Code/OR_encode.R")
```

## Plot the Results

The third case introduces a logical OR relationship between four variables of the form:

<h5 align="center"><i>AB + CD = Z</i></h5>

There are two variables in a logical AND relationship on either side of a
logical OR operator.  For the reasons explained previously, this situation poses
a challenge to this method because the way that the apparent critical ranges are
determined ensures that a logical AND and a logical OR relationship appear
identical.  If a logical OR relationship exists, the training set exhibits the
distinctive pattern shown in the following plots.

```{r fit_models, echo=FALSE}
message("Detecting groups...")
dstruct     <- organize(dset_train)
dset_groups <- dstruct$groups
message("  Done.")

# This code block uses a specialized routine called "modelfit" which is a
# generalized routine that fits data to a specified model type.  It was made
# to simplify the interface and make the code more succinct.
message("Fitting Models...")
# SQ means square rectified, which is a LASSO run on transformed data
message("Fitting initial models...")
model_1 <- modelfit(data = dset_train, dtype = "SQ", groups = dset_groups,
                    params = list(sdfilter = NULL))
# LS just means LASSO
model_2 <- modelfit(data = dset_train, dtype = "LS", groups = dset_groups)
message("  Done.")
```

The perfect classification of the positive examples and poor classification
performance of the negative examples is a distinctive relationship that occurs
primarily when there is a logical OR relationship present.  Once this is known,
steps can be taken to make the additional computational investment of creating
the different versions of the features that might exist with different critical
ranges and then fitting the new (much larger) data set.  

```{r transformed_data_plots, echo=FALSE}
hpos <- 0.4
message("Plotting transformed data examples...")
plot(model_1, title = "Case #3 Training Set", h=.5, cx = hpos)
plot(model_1, title = "Case #3 Test Set", data = dset_test, h=.5, cx = hpos)
message("  Done.")
```

Without calculating the extra versions, the un-transformed data actually
outperforms the transformed data.

```{r untransformed_data_plots, echo=FALSE}
message("Plotting un-transformed data examples...")
plot(model_2, title = "Case #3 Training Set (no transformation)", h=.5,
     cx = hpos)
plot(model_2, title = "Case #3 Test Set (no transformation)",
     data = dset_test, h=.5, cx = hpos)
message("  Done.")
```

The computational advantage is decisively reversed when the extra versions are
calculated because of the extreme size of the new data set being fitted to the
model.  However, the increase in performance in terms of the accuracy of the
model when compared to the non-transformed data is arguably worth expending the
extra computational energy to produce the much better results.  The next plots
show the success of the fit against the test set with the extra versions
calculated.

```{r fit_models_ev, echo=FALSE}
message("Calculating additional feature versions that *might* exist...")
dset_train_SQ  <- rectify(dset_train, groups = dset_groups, sdfilter = NULL)
dset_train_SQO <- OR_encode(dset_train_SQ, stride = 600,
                            feats = unlist(dset_groups))
# the encoded data set is returned inverted, reverting back for this application
dset_train_SQO$data$INDC <- !dset_train_SQO$data$INDC
for (f in unlist(dset_train_SQO$groups)) 
  dset_train_SQO$data[,f] <- -dset_train_SQO$data[,f]
dset_test_SQ  <- rectify(dset_test, limits = dset_train_SQ$limits,
                         groups = dset_train_SQ$groups, sdfilter = NULL)
dset_test_SQO <- OR_encode(dset_test_SQ, limits = dset_train_SQO$limits,
                           stride = 600, feats = unlist(dset_groups))
# the encoded data set is inverted, reverting for this application
dset_test_SQO$data$INDC <- !dset_test_SQO$data$INDC
for (f in unlist(dset_train_SQO$groups)) 
  dset_test_SQO$data[,f] <- -dset_test_SQO$data[,f]
message("Fitting new models...")
model_1a <- modelfit(data = dset_train_SQO$data, dtype = "LS")
message("  Done.")
```

It is clear from the performance of the new training set that there is a
significant performance boost when the new versions of each feature with
slightly different critical ranges are created. The level of additional
computational power is very significant, however.  The original data set for
Case III was 3,437 examples with 56 features each, but when the new versions are
calculated to a modest resolution the data set expands to 3,437 examples with
526 features each.  That is approximately one-sixhundredth of the maximum
possible size of the expanded version set.  Remarkably, however, it appears to
be enough to create a reasonably accurate model.  Fig. 17 shows the test set
when applied to the model created with the limited number of extra versions, and
the performance advantage over the LASSO applied to the original continuous data
is markedly large.

```{r transformed_data_plots_ev, echo=FALSE}
hpos <- 0.4
plot(model_1a, title = "Case #3 Training Set (with extra versions)", h = 0.5,
     cx = hpos)
plot(model_1a, title = "Case #3 Test Set (with extra versions)",
     data = dset_test_SQO$data, h = 0.5, cx = hpos)
```

The LASSO results with the unmodified continuous data shown above indicate that
while there is definitely a relationship, the difficulty in creating a model in
which multiple features within the same data set can independently cause the
same result is evident. While limiting the size of the expanded data set with
the multiple versions produces a highly accurate model, the cost is that the
interpretability of the coefficients suffers (see the coefficient bar plot
below).  In order to regain that interpretability, the features must be
disentangled such that the logical OR relationships are removed, and each set of
events on either side of the 'OR' operator modeled separately.

```{r transformed_data_barplot_ev, echo=FALSE}
TRANS   <- 0.2
BARHT   <- 15
beta1   <- model_1a$model$beta[,]
markers <- rep(0,length(beta1))
cols    <- rep(rgb(0,0,0,0), length(beta1))

cols[grep("^V1TM5_", names(beta1))]     <- rgb(1.0, 0.0, 0.0,TRANS) #RED

markers[grep("^V5TM8_", names(beta1))]  <- BARHT

par(new=FALSE, mar = c(6,3,3,2))
barplot(beta1, border = "blue", col = "blue", ylim = c(-0.5, BARHT), las = 2,
        xaxt = "n")

par(new=TRUE)
bplot <- barplot(markers, border = cols, col = cols, ylim = c(-0.5, BARHT),
                 axes = FALSE)
cnames <- c("V1TM5", "V2TM10", "V4TM3", "V5TM8")
bplot_at <- NULL
labs     <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(cnames)) {
  labs <- c(labs, names(beta1)[grep(paste0("^",cnames[i],"_"),names(beta1))])
  bplot_at <- c(bplot_at,grep(paste0("^",cnames[i],"_"),names(beta1)))
}
bplot_labels <- rep(NA, length(beta1))
bplot_labels[bplot_at] <- labs
axis(1, at = bplot, labels =bplot_labels, las=2, cex.axis=0.7, tick=FALSE)
```

The colored bars are of varying width in the previous plot because every
variable and lag may not have the same number of alternate versions with varied
critical ranges; that all depends on how many points exist inside the critical
range but are not coincident with a positive response.
